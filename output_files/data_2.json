As a country we're not rich, our economy is on the rise after many years of havoc. So parents aren't well-off either and offspring won't leave home until their mid to late 20s (I left at 23 to go abroad but that's another story). Some kids will work while in University, others won't in order to focus/finish. Kids that do work may sometimes opt to leave early/live in different cities. I have not come across many occasions of kids staying in to play video games and do nothing (I'm sure it happens, it's just not common). On the contrary, they will work stupid hours for stupid wages.  Once they are ready and able financially they will leave home, which is always considered their home. My parents' never considered our family house theirs alone, and my husband and I will never consider our home ours alone and not our kids'. Unless you have been catered to and have been complacent your entire life, financial responsibility is a life lesson learned by everyone, especially in wounded economies. There's no other way. Parents will help offspring financially no matter how old they are; in return, we will look after our parents till the end, not out of obligation, but out of gratitude and love. It's a 'what's mine is yours' culture - in a wider sense.\n\nDepending on your household income, kids who work will of course contribute to bills, maintenance and anything else needed. If their salary is too low, which quite often happens, they will help their parents every other way possible. Grandparents will look after their grandkids on a consistent basis happily, not as chore; and we will look after our parents/grandparents in every way possible. Nursing homes are not a thing here unless there's no other option; same with boarding schools - I don't even know whether we have them.\n\nIt's cultural, I do get it. I know and understand that most parents love their children more than anything and they do what's best for them the way they think best. So no judging. It's just weird to me, that's all.", "I don‚Äôt know how common it is to actually do that, but I know some people who have at least discussed doing this with their kid ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs usually because the (adult) kid has decided that they want to live at home and play video games all day instead of having a job and it‚Äôs their way of trying to get the kid to have some kind of adult responsibilities (the idea is usually that the money will be put into savings).", "That shits fowl ive never understood that.

Long read incoming üòÇ\nI had the privilege of falling in love a few times. The first was love, but we were too young to actually understand that it is more than just the butterflies. We stopped building on the butterfly foundation, and that was it. \nI fell in love later on in life, but after a year or two all what was left was the idea of what that love could be. I held on to the potential of that love for seven heartbreaking years, until I no longer wanted to chase dying butterflies. I pulled the plug and I didn't even mourn it one second. The only thing I was sad about, was that it took me so long to finally decide we deserved another life. My ex built a new life and I can see he is happy again. He is the man I used to love again. And I am who I used to be again. Makes me think of Robin and Barnie in HYMYM. We couldn't help each other to find the best in ourselves. \n\nThen, I fell in love again. On a different level. I continued the life I've built on my own and organically he just fits in. I didn't change myself a bit, and neither did he. We just accept each other and we complement each other. We feel like best friends (with amazing benefits, honestly) and I never, ever doubted my relationship again. And no. He is not perfect, neither am I. But we are in this happy shitshow called life together, and because of that we can handle it. \n\nSo I guess I believe in love. But love does not equal a healthy relationship.

He's very much a nerd and recently announced as autistic, which makes perfect sense. But yes, for his early career, he was very talented, motivated, and worked long hours. He's a smart guy who benefited from wealthy or upper middle class parents so he could focus on whatever he wanted, plus, in typical teenage fashion, found a way to exploit loopholes. He got unlimited computer lab time at his school in the early days when few people had ever touched a computer. He combined his resources, work ethic, obsessive passion for learning, and lucky opportunity to create an advantage. Then he was at least savy enough to team with good¬† business partners.

Unlike Jobs or Zuckerberg. None of those guys are above average morally, but I'm not aware of Gates being depraved. Even Microsoft's most aggressive business practices are what I'd characterize as average on the scale of corporate evilness. Even the 1998 internet explorer monopoly lawsuit was one of the mildest antitrust cases among hundreds of companies I can think of. The average evil American businessman dumps leather tanning chemicals into river drinking water, blocks fire exits, sells you their own brand of insurance pretending it is impartial financial advice, etc. As far as I know, Gates hasn't done anything to even rival that.¬†\n\n\nAnyway, I don't know what point you're trying to make. My point was that GWB was probably the closest we've ever seen in modern America of an average talent, average intelligence, average motivation (average compared to the middle class) guy holding a major political office. And it still took dozens of shadow players with a lifetime of political prestige and another decade of efforts, a lot of money, and a famous name, to put him there.

But I wouldn't characterize any of them as greedy for that or eager to kill their mothers for a buck.¬†\n\n\nAnd where did you infer my opinions on meritocracy from? I didn't say Bill Gates is a better person or more deserving of praise or anything like that. I gave you an account of my assessments of Bill Gates' talent and work ethic based on what I've read because you asked for it. Meanwhile you're handwaving it away because you start with the presumption that everyone is the same, with no further rationalization. Have you poured most of your waking hours to mastering a new skillset in an underappreciated emerging field and then applied it to develop a product that filled a large niche that your competitors left open? I think based on the history (even accounting for embellishment), it's fair to say that young Bill Gates was somewhere well above average in talent and above average in motivation and work ethic. It's frankly bizarre to say, nope he's the same as everyone else.¬†\n\n\nMeritocracy for what? I didn't say he deserves like more food or a hotter wife than Bob from accounting or Dr. Fauci or Usain Bolt or Shamwow Guy? It seems you're assigning judgment and human value when none were discussed.\n\n\nSome people are smarter than others. Some people work harder than others. Some people are more compassionate than others. Some people are more artistic. Some people are more charismatic. Some people are better managers than others. Some people are better executives than others. Some are better theorists. Some are better project developers. Some people are more athletic. Some people are luckier. Some are more driven. Some find a niche they excel at. Some could find that niche but happen to never find it. Some people don't have a niche. Some people have different combinations of attributes. Some people have a lot of those attributes.¬†\n\n\nNone of that is a value judgment or whatever you were implying by 'meritocracy'.¬†\n\n\nBut to my original point several comments ago, a functioning modern economy and government requires specialization. That includes people who eventually culminate their careers by specializing as executives. People who are good at big picture strategy, formulating cohesive visions and aligning efforts under those visions, and are able organize teams of advisors on wide topics to give them a range of options to choose from. And consistently making good choices from that advice. That in itself is a skillset (actually a combination of multiple skillsets) that takes years of active effort to develop. To say that you can have a functioning modern society where national policy decisions are made by random people off the street is absurd. And that's just for the decisionmaking itself. The additional skillsets needed to maintain an organization that continues to work toward your objectives is a whole additional matter. And then the skillsets from your whole team needed to maintain the mandate of the voting population.¬†\n\n\nThere's just no way to have a government run by people who choose to not make a career of it. There's just way too much involved for anyone to walk in and just be able to make a good decision or vote on the right thing. And it takes too much to even get to the point where everyone agrees that Joe from the street was the right person to make that decision. Even 200 years ago, a republic was required to run the country. And today the decisions that our elected representatives, governors, and presidents make are even more complicated than they were 200 years ago.¬†\n\n\nAnd none of that is a *value* judgment about those people, like you are alleging.¬†", "I was waiting for NVIDIA trade to be mentioned. \n\n1) Nvidia isn't a chip maker and weren't slated to get any subsidies and they actually opposed the legislation.

He would also often harm himself if I upset him. But, I had no other friends or family there and my job did not pay enough for me to be on my own in a relatively HCOL city. We also got rid of my car during the move as it was too old to make it across the country, so I was dependent on him for that too. \n\n\nI started becoming closer with people at work as they were my only escape from him. They unfortunately witnessed some of his insane behavior (he would stumble in there drunk fairly often) and I began to open up to them more about what I was going through. In particular, to one guy I worked with because he was always very realistic with me and a good listener. \n\n\nNo boundaries were crossed for a long time.

Around the same time, I realized my feelings for my coworker. And, I just so happened to land a better paying job with benefits that would allow me more stability on my own, and was walkable from my apartment. \n\n\nSo I tried to break up with my ex once and for all. It didn‚Äôt work well. He threatened to kill himself, I ended up locking myself in the bedroom while he screamed and raged and attacked himself with a razor. It was incredibly traumatizing and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. He refused to leave and I had nowhere else to go. \n\n\nLater that week was my last day at my old job and so I went out with my coworkers to celebrate. My ex was god knows where getting drunk. My coworker offered to drive me home, and when he dropped me off I asked him if he wanted to kiss me. He said yes, so we did. I ran into my apartment and told him I had made a huge mistake, and long story short it led to a confession from him that he had had feelings for me for a while but always wanted to respect my relationship and not cross boundaries. \n\n\nI ended up successfully ending things with my ex a few days later. It was horrific, he destroyed many of my belongings, punched holes in our doors, there was broken glass all over the apartment, he was threatening to kill me with a knife in his hand and it was so loud multiple neighbors called the police. They showed up and he fled and never came back. I haven‚Äôt seen him since. \n\n\nBut I did start dating my old coworker. And I still am to this day.

I said fuck it, grabbed a 6 pack of my favorite beer, a bottle of wine I had in the fridge and went to his place. We put on a movie, had a beer or two and just talked.

A few weeks later, our downstairs tenants moved out because she would shout to herself alone upstairs, and haad called the police at least once thinking somone had broken into the house. I used this opportunity to move back in, but separately. One day soon after, she was talking about the neighbors having a loud argument outside and mentioned hearing something about her name and her mother's. We didn't even know those neighbors, and I decided that she was getting help or I was done forever.\n\nWhile I was living at my parents' house, I found myself spending time with a mutual female friend whom I had known for over 10 years. Nothing inappropriate, but we connected on some level at that time, and feelings developed below the surface. I gave my ex the ultimatum that she needed to see a doctor with me; or I was not going to be there for her any longer. She declined, and I made my choice. It became clear who I wanted to be with. She was out of town; so I drove overnight to be with her. \n\nThere was a month of sneaking around (we were still effectively separated but had not officially ended the relationship), and then a 6-month standoff as we divided assets (her family was insanely wealthy,  having paid for 30% of our house in cash upfront). I continued dating my new partner throughout this time.  We are still together, nearly 5 years later, and I never imagined how much better life could be. I don't recommend doing things this way. My addiction spiraled further out of control in those early years, almost causing this relationship to crash and burn as well. I finally found myself with something worth saving, so I made the effort to get sober.", "It only happened once in one relationship and they never found out and I felt terrible afterwards. It was a group situation and only quick for a minute then I stopped and hated myself because I did what caused my terrible trust issues in previous relationships and I was now on the other side of the equation. I still don‚Äôt know why people do it but at the same my ex was being very emotionally abusive especially around me finding out I was autistic and unaware the first three decades of my life when it was obvious looking back now. Welcome to being sheltered with invisible disabilities. Anyways that ex was my best friend for a decade before the relationship and a year into it he became very abusive (not physically) and our relationship was long distance so my family was confused why I wasn‚Äôt living with him, and at some point I had enough and it was done solely to cause pain but he never found out and to be honest I don‚Äôt think he would really care that much. We‚Äôre back to being best friends again and since then we‚Äôre back to the friendship we‚Äôve had. \n\nI honestly don‚Äôt know why people cheat other than an insecure and immature way to hurt their partner when they should just communicate that the relationship needs to grow or both of you need to move on. I mostly see it being because the POS sees their partner as a possession to them that they can control and manipulate their emotions to get an ego high or because they aren‚Äôt sexually attracted ti their partner and are using them for some other purpose or lastly they‚Äôre insecure about their partner finding someone better so they cause them pain so they won‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs someone better.", "Cheated him back when i got to know he cheated on me as simple as that.", "I cheated on my ex boyfriend with my current husband. \n\nBecause, I caught him cheating on me with a coworker and someone who I consider a friend. I forgave him, and he did it again and again and again. \n\nOne day, I just got tired of the lies, the shouting, the stress and all of those things. So i installed tinder.\n\nNever looked back. \n\n\nThat and im just an overall shitty person.", "Don't ask me, ask her. I still have no idea or had any apology in several years now. It's a different life that I never saw coming.", "My ex was a dick to me and didn't put in the same amount of effort as I did into our relationship. I eventually realized he wasn't gonna change. \n\nMeanwhile, I sorta developed a small crush on a friend. My best friend then facilitated hooking us up since she hated by ex. Eventually, I ended up sleeping with my friend after a party. I told my ex what happened and he didn't seem to care. We broke up and three months later, my friend asked me to be his gf. \n\nOur ten year anniversary is next month.", "A bunch of excuses", "We both have a lot of unresolved traumas and our dedication to each other was no longer actually serving each other. Just routine. I wanted to be poured into in ways that were free- she developed a gambling issue. Neither of us deserve half love. After years of communicating the same thing - I‚Äôd had enough. Trying to end a relationship with someone who is wholly dependent on the other  isn‚Äôt easy.", "I cheated on my first love. Twice. Felt like shit, and I should have ended shit between us but I was addicted to her. \n\nI (F) was totally, desperately in love with this girl. When I first saw her when I was 14, I was immediately in love. I remember everything about that day still to this day. I still smell the smell of shae butter oil on her hair/skin. We finally became a couple, and shortly after this other girl asked in a very high school immature way to be my girlfriend and I said, \"Sure.\" That was the first cheat. Stupid and I owned up to it and told her. Lol. \n\nFor the next 10ish years, it was a roller coaster ride of toxicity on both our parts. We'd break up, we'd get another partner, we'd break up with them and get back together.\n\nMy issues were that I was extremely insecure and had little self-worth. I have body image issues and vanity issues because of PCOS (facial hair, body hair). This would cause me to be clingy and emotional. I also had unchecked depression. I felt like she didn't like me nor love me even though she said she did. I couldn't get past that. \n\nOn the other hand, I feel like (not sure because we never really talked about it) she was trying really hard to please her mother, and she was afraid of disappointing her expectations by being with a woman. She also had a crude sense of humor. 99% of the time I can handle it, but because I was in love with her and was feeling unworthy of her.. the sense of humor felt rejecting to me constantly which made me even more clingy. \n\nSo it was a circle for us. We'd be going along well, then she'd say something or make a joke, or be busy with something and not respond to me.. My insecurity would start making me clingy, she'd push me away or get mad. Then we'd argue. We'd either break up or if we werent official, we'd stop talking and start talking to someone else. We did this all the way up until I was 27 or so. \n\nDuring our last rodeo, we had agreed if it didn't work this time.. we were done. And I was moving on. Everything was going okay; we got a dog together, I was progressing towards a degree and a career I felt like, she was doing good at her job, we went on vacations. The second vacation however, we came home and she ghosted me for 2 or 3 days. My insecurity kicked in and we argued about it. I was asking her or telling her rather, communicate with me please. If you need time to yourself, let me know and I won't react the way I do. It happened again. To me in hindsight, a lot of miscommunication and insecurity between both of us. \n\nOne time during the middle our relationship when she ghosted me, I was lonely, drinking, and thinking about ending things whenever she did respond to me... In my head, I was essentially thinking, \"Screw her and screw women. I'm going to get a man to knock me up and be single with a kid. I dont need a partner..\" So I hit up this guy (I'm a lesbian, so this was just out of pure spite) I use to talk to online, never met in person. We met up and fooled around. I felt horrible AF. I was freaking out thinking I was pregnant because we didn't use protection. It was very high stress moment and I felt like garbage. \n\nI never told her. For some reason after this though, our \"relationship\" turned in to I believe strictly about sex. We never had sex up until this point, and she gave me a look one night while we were arguing. So it happened and it was pretty good on her end.. I just couldn't open up on my end though I tried. We continued on for another year or so. I believe she told me she was going to break up with me the night we did have sex, but we had sex and she liked it a lot so she kept going. \n\nFinally, we had a huge fallout. Me being a idiot proposed thinking it fix shit and we were engaged for all of 1 day, and then game over. \n\nAt this time, I was 300 pounds due to the stress and depression. I was eating 4 McChickens and a full 12 cookie tote from McDonalds for lunch everyday. Sometimes a whole pizza. Plus a large sweet tea and large fry. \n\nThen a switch flicked in my head. I got my depression in order, made amends with friends I kicked to the curb, and lost almost 100 pounds. I was thriving. We continued to kind of talk through this moment in time. Until she blew up at me for my emotions. I realized we aren't going to work at all and I need to continue to work on myself. Still never told her about me cheating.  \n\nI continued on my diet and self-love journey. And I was talking on dating sites for about a month after finally ending it with her. I got bored with that quick, so I was logging in to delete everything and I got to the last profile and had a message. \n\nIt was from the woman I am laying next to right now. My life absolutely blossomed after meeting her. We got engaged 6 months after our first date and I have never been so sure. And we've been together for 8 years so far, planning to get married this October and I'm adopting her son as my own. I am almost done with college, been on Dean's list, work a great government job, won multiple awards, have a brand new car and buying a house this fall. \n\nI got what was coming to me though, my current fiancee cheated on me emotionally. It hurt so fucking bad. I just bought her a new car and started a new job after losing my business during covid. But we worked on it and got through it. We communicated and understood why it happened. I was closed off from the toxicity of my ex. With my ex I was giving and giving and giving. With my current fiancee, I closed off. She tried telling me the issues, but I ignored them due to stress from closing my business during COVID. She needed someone to talk to and got wrapped up with this guy. Bout killed me. I also do have random fucking dreams about my ex, it's like a damn hemorrhoid that won't go away.", "Ask your mother", "I met my 22yo boyfriend when I was just 15. I dropped out of high school to smoke cigarettes and weed all day and night while he played video games. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no high school diploma, or job. I stayed with him for about threeish years.\n\nThen I met someone more my age and my next horrible decision. He was homeless, but a ‚Äúhot surfer,‚Äù yay my type üòí so I cheated on boyfriend number one with number two and stayed with him for four horrible years. He cheated on me many times with many different girls.\n\nWe would often physically fight and he was mentally abusive to the point of spreading lies and rumors about me and my friends on the internet we all lived in a small town where everybody knew everybody so that fucking sucked. He never had a job, had a fucked up family, and financially abused me to the point where I later had to file for bankruptcy.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if it was love or if I just felt sorry for him, but I wanted it to work??? He had no respect for me and I had even less respect for myself. I want to say about a month into us being official and mind you he was already living with me he started acting crazy like literally mentally ill.\n\nIt got to the point where I cut off all my friends because I was afraid of how he would act when I spent time with them. He would accuse me of sleeping around and rant to my family about it. It got really really dark. At one point, one of his ‚Äúclose‚Äù friends who I never even liked became the target of his accusations. He genuinely believed this guy was a cult leader and that I was being preyed on. He said I was secretly hooking up with both him and his girlfriend as part of some kind of magic ritual, and that became the basis of the Facebook expos√© he posted about me and said friend. \n\nEventually, I just snapped. I stopped caring about what he thought and started going out again, reconnected with my friends and to cope, I started drinking heavily and abusing a popular party drug. It felt like survival at the time, but it only made me spiral. \n\nWe broke up when I could no longer deal with him coming home with hickies all over his neck or not coming home at all. He kept kinda coming back into my life over about a year, mostly to fight and have toxic sex, but I know it was really truly over when I was finally tired of being embarrassed.\n\nI ruined my life. I had to leave the state to get away from him. He ended up marrying one of the women he cheated on me with, and she knew about me the whole time so the cycle continues.

Been faithfully married for 16 years now though.", "[deleted]", "I suppose my story is close enough to cheating to count.  I weas married for 15 years, but for more than half of that my partner was suffering from severe depression.  It was extremely hard on both of us, and even after they managed to get it under control, we were pretty much just civil roomates. I did meet a new friend around that time, and it caught me by surprise when I caught feelings.  In that sense you could say there was emotional cheating while I was still married.  I didn't get a divorce to be with this new person, not exactly.  But they did make me realize that I wanted and deserved something more.", "I was with my ex for four years. We had started dating in high school and eventually got an apartment together. In the last two years of our relationship, he cheated on me with multiple different girls, was using cocaine in our bathroom despite me pleading with him not to, was high all day every day, and when he would get mad it scared me. We were rarely intimate, but when we were I was pressured into it.\n\nHaving an apartment together made me feel trapped, and when I tried to communicate he would guilt trip me, make it seem like the issues in our relationship were my fault, or pull the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the only one who‚Äôs ever cared about me‚Äù card. Typical emotional manipulation stuff. \n\nI needed some kind of escape, so I decided to go on a semester abroad to the UK. Four months to give myself some distance and some time to think, but we didn‚Äôt break up. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail, but long distance proved a lot of the things I had already been feeling about our relationship.\n\nLong story short, I met a guy on my semester abroad, we clicked immediately, and I ended up sleeping with him while I was still in a relationship with my ex. I felt a bit bad about doing it, but it also felt like revenge for all the emotional turmoil my ex had put me through with his cheating.\n\nEnded up having an affair of sorts for about five days, then called my ex and broke up with him over the phone. I‚Äôm now living in the UK with the guy I met here and we‚Äôre engaged. I‚Äôd say it worked out well for me and I no longer feel bad about sleeping with him while still in a relationship with a dirtbag of a guy ü§£\n\nETA: I still feel deeply regretful about the fact that I was a coward and cheated instead of just breaking up with my ex first. If I could go back I would have broken up with my ex long before that ever happened and I‚Äôll never cheat again.

Didn‚Äôt really feel anything for any of them as was emotionally unavailable big time. \nOriginal girl came in and out of my life. We would see each other for a few weeks and then I‚Äôd not see her for ages. \nWent to a party to see her and she was draped all over my mate. So I thought that was the end of that. Met another girl and was with her for a few month, she was younger and I didn‚Äôt even want to be with her really but the sex was on tap and easy. \nOriginal girl came back into my life one way or another don‚Äôt even remember. Tried to stay away, but never could. We had sex and the fact that I didn‚Äôt care at all for my girlfriend‚Äôs feelings cemented I needed out of that relationship.

Seeing that man go from everything I couldn't stand to the man I had begged him to be for years in such a desperate, pathetic way was more painful than the look on his face when I coldly blurted out the fact that I slept with someone else because I didn't know how else to get the point across to him that I didn't love him anymore.\n\nJust leave.

The husband would also shame his family, but not nearly as much.\n\nBut if the culture has certain conditions like adultery that make seeking divorce acceptable, then the only way for a partner and their family to save face is for the other partner to meet those conditions. This will still bring shame to the family, but not nearly as much. If the man commits adultery, the woman won't get off scot-free: she will live with gossipers speculating what she'd done or didn't do to make him cheat, and some of that will carry over to questions about what kind of parents she had. But that is better for her and her family than the stigma about her being the sort of daughter that just disregards her parents and her marital commitments and embarrasses her in-laws and her parents being the story of people to raise such an immoral person. This, potentially coupled with the fact that she is no longer (believed to be) a virgin, will damage her future prospects at marriage significantly.\n\nIf the situation is reversed and the woman commits adultery, the best case scenario is becoming a pariah--and not just figuratively. She will lose all family support and be denied access to almost all social interaction. Her parents will forever suffer repercussions, but if they disown her, those repercussions are often learned to being looked down on and their other children having difficulty getting arranged spouses. This is all far better than imprisonment and murder, which is the outcome in certain cultures.\n\nExplaining all this is hard. There is the feminist explanation that the woman is an object to be transacted, and her seeking or agreeing to divorce represents a rejection of the entire system that objectifies her. There is a lot of truth in this explanation, but it is not the complete picture.\n\nFor most of human history, we've lived in tiny groups of no more than 40 people. Marriage often entailed a lot of material hardship due to one adult moving from one group to another. Dowries served a number of functions. In some places the dowry goes to the family being married into, and it secures not just a marriage into a family with status but the well-being of their child and their proper treatment once moved in. In other places, the dowry goes to the family or group that is losing the person to moving away as a sort of compensation for the loss of labor and also as collateral that their person will (a) commit to the new group or the new group will seek a refund and (b) the new group will treat the person who's marrying in well enough that they do not run back to their family and leave the new group empty handed. In short, marriage carried real material impacts and risks for families and for small groups, and the social structuration of marriage had to accommodate that material reality.\n\nThis got a lot more complex as group sizes got larger and more sedentary and technological innovation resulted in more permanent hunting and warring parties and, in turn, more staunchly patriarchal social organization. Marriage still has material impacts and risks, but chauvinistic ideology is often used to (a) hold women disproportionately or uniquely responsible for being \"good spouses\" and (b) mistreating them if they do not follow these behavioral expectations. To put it directly, women are threatened into submission and treated not as persons but conjugal good. What is more, this threat extends to families as it affects their social status of its members and the marryability of their children, both of which have very real material consequences in terms of what opportunities and resources they have access to.\n\nChauvinism is very much the lens through which many families and cultures judge women in arranged marriages, but their calculus also includes considerations about what social and material benefits these arrangements secure for these women (and men and families as a while.) If the entire culture is telling these parents the only way for your daughter (or son) to succeed is through this formula, then the parents want to make sure they carry out that formula to the best of their ability. They might buy into the patriarchal formula hook, line, and sinker, but they also might reluctantly participate to secure their child's future. It's *Pride and Prejudice*.\n\nIn most moved industrialized countries, arranged marriage is no longer acceptable. That is largely due to the fact that as long as you marry within your class,  material security is relatively certain and unaffected by marriage. But families often revert to heated opinions about their children's choice of spouse if that partner represents a potential risk to their social or material status. Many parents are not okay with their child marrying someone from a poorer, less educated, less \"traditional\" family or someone who is related to or is themself a minority that experiences social disadvantage. Plenty of those parents are classist or bigoted, but plenty are concerned about their own child's own opportunities in the face of a classist or bigoted social environment. This is a sort of modern version of arranged marriage, where the parents do not select the spouse, but create parameters that define who is selectable. Fortunately, these societies are at least more accepting of divorce.", "It's a way for the wife to save face.

Some of my friends tried to raise concerns about first bf when things started getting bad, and I was so grateful to him for the positives from early in the relationship that I just wouldn't hear it.

If he'd been someone I had no emotional connection with, I wouldn't have allowed him in enough to start honestly talking about how bad things were. And hearing what I was saying was a huge wake-up call for me. If I hadn't talked about how bad it was out loud, it would have taken me so much longer to realize how fucked up things were. First bf had felt like my entire support network for so long that I couldn't admit how toxic he was, even to my psychiatrist (I was in weekly talk therapy at the time and held almost all of it back).\n\nThis isn't me avoiding accountability.

I would have stayed with first bf for *at least* a year or two longer, becoming less and less my own person, if I hadn't had an emotional connection strong enough to allow me to start admitting that things in my first relationship weren't okay.   \n\nCurrent me absolutely wouldn't cheat on my husband; I have grown enough as a person to either work on fixing things or just get a divorce first if our relationship soured. Our relationship is incredibly healthy, and we are both committed to prioritizing one another. But early-20's me *did not have the ability* to even acknowledge her relationship as abusive, let alone get out of it before falling for someone else.", "Oh GREAT point, I actually forgot that was in the initial question. If you are an archetypal serial cheater and have a succession of 10 mistresses and never leave your wife for them you‚Äôre totally selected out of answering the question in the first place.

It's not like they could disfellowship him or make him prove it anyways.", "What is the religious reason behind this?", "Even if they could legally have a no-fault divorce, some cultures pretty much require some kind of provable fault before they will acknowledge a divorce.", "But it's clear that the fault was on him.\n\nMany religious cultures have a 'just try harder' attitude to failing marriages that says any breakdown in a relationship can be solved by the people just sticking it out and trying harder, and not doing so is a moral failure on behalf of both parties.\n\n However cheating is almost always an exception to this so if he cheated, it clears the wife to divorce him without any community backlash. It makes it look like she was trying, but he chose to break the marriage. \n\nAlso, some religions will not recognise a divorce at all under any other circumstances even if it is obtained legally, meaning he could have legally divorced her and left but she might not have been allowed to date/remarry in the church because the church still saw her as married to her first husband.", "Cheating on a rapist doesn't really count, IMO.", "I don't necessarily think he deserved it.

In reality, you are still married to your partner and thus dating, let alone \"Marrying\" another person is adultery against your real spouse (who you haven't seen in 10 years).\n\nI guess the theory is that if your previous partner has conducted adultery, then the marriage has already been fouled up by adultery and thus it isn't too bad if you do it yourself.\n\n/s", "That was one of my thoughts too.

I know that isn't your question, but to outsiders, Catholics seem hyper-traditional because the Church is the oldest living institution in the world.  It has two main functions: relay and interpret the Word of God to all fellow man so as they can enjoy being welcomed to God, and second, SOMEHOW hold the ENTIRE world's Catholic population, priests, and institutions, in every country, in every language, in every socio-economic and political landscape - to a single set of standards that they are held accountable to.

There is this little thing called taking the lords name in vain. Many Christians think it just means we can say naughty things about Christ. However this has been twisted over the years. What it actually means is to claim the name of Christ but then to behave in an ungodly way. And Trump fits that bill to a T. To him it appears the name of Christ is a tool to be used to manipulate the idea‚Äôs and perceptions of Christian‚Äôs. Because he certainly doesn‚Äôt display any of the fruits of the spirit, Joy, Love, peace, patience, forgiveness, Kindness and goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."]}

Decided to do a loop and some barrel roll something, I don‚Äôt know but I ended up trying to puke out of a two seater window because he had no vomit bags. It was an astonishing amount and it went everywhere. After he landed, he took me home and still made a play.

I was between places at the time and was living with friend, who still lived with him Mum and Sister. So about 2am we're getting things started downstairs on the living room floor, having taken all the sofa cushions off and laid them down. A few minutes into it, I felt a sharp pain. I pulled out and sprayed blood everywhere. My GF grabbed a t-shirt and I applied it to my spurting genitalia. She had to get dressed, go upstairs, and wake my friends Mum to take me to the hospital. I managed to throw some jeans and a t-shirt on, and they dropped us off. Waited about an hour to get cleaned up and a Junior Doctor tells me I'd cut myself somehow, so he washed the blood away and applied some weird jelly stuff to clot the wound, bandaged it up and sent me on my way. Mates Mum picked us up, and we went and crashed on the sofa. I didn't even wait to get undressed. \n\nFew hours later, I wake up and my jeans are covered in blood. I make my way upstairs and the clotting jelly, now stained red with blood, starts dropping out the legs. I make it to the toilet, sit down and it looks like I'm literally pissing blood. So again, we have to wake my friends Mum and go back to the hospital. As it's now 7am, I get an actual Doctor who again cleans me up and tells me that I've torn through my frenulum. They take me into a room and lay me down, and gives me a local anaesthetic in the tip of my dick, then proceeds to sew it back on. One of my hands is tightly gripping the bed, the other is being held by my GF, and I'm swearing at the Doctor because whilst it doesn't hurt, I can still feel the sensation of having it sewn back on. All the time my GF is watching him do it, absolutely fascinated. \n\nFinally get back to my friends house and have to ring my boss and tell him why I can't come into work for a few days. He absolutely pisses himself laughing. This was pre-Facebook so I'm confident that no one outside of that household knows what happened.

So he sprang for a hotel (classy, right?), and we agreed to meet at the room that afternoon.\n\nI pull into the hotel parking lot and I see him walking into the lobby, carrying a box of something I can't make out. I'm disappointed. His pictures were already blah to begin with, but in person he was worse lol. But I figure I'm already there, he's paid for the room, I'll see where this goes. It was my \"Do it for the plot\" moment.\n\nSo I trek up to the room. Upon entering he offers me a beer, which turns out to be the box he was carrying - a 24 pack. I thought that was a little ambitious but desperately needed that drink. I took it eagerly and take a big sip and he....chugs an entire can. Then says he hasn't had alcohol in years. I ask why, thinking maybe his ex partner had aversions or for religious reasons. Nope. \n\n\"Oh I'm an alcoholic\" He cracks open his second beer in as many minutes and I immediately set mine down, deciding to remain absolutely sober for this. I say \"Well thats a choice.\" I make a mental note that if I'm going to have a successful ho phase I should invest in pepper spray and I probably should have informed a friend of my whereabouts. Rookie behavior.\n\nHe finishes his second beer and asks if I want to take a shower. I figure that's as good a way to get things started as any so I agree. We head to the shower and strip. I again am..... disappointed. There are so many times I should have just left. And this was another of them. But alas. The plot.\n\nWe get in the shower, and I'm expecting a little foreplay or something. Some teasing or touching. Nah. He immediately shoves his tongue down my throat and wrenching on my tits. Now I don't mind rough. But come on dude. The whole time he's kissing me, I'm thinking to myself \"Oh my god, where are his teeth? Does he not have teeth? how did I miss that he has no teeth?\" So yeah, obviously really into the moment. Turns out he does have teeth he's just THAT bad of a kisser. \n\nHe then grabs my hand and has me stroke him. Now I am not a tall woman. I am not even 5'1\". I have small hands. Like I had to quit playing the cello small hands.. And when I had him in my hand, my fingers overlapped. Not touched.... OVER. LAPPED. By at least a knuckle. He didn't let me do a whole lot before he tried to fuck me in the shower. He slipped. Twice. Almost fell on his ass. We got out of the shower. \n\nWe finally make it to the bed and I'm homestly surprised the condom didn't just fall right off. He lasts for literal seconds. And as he's finishing he's yelling \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!\" And I'm trying to tell him it's fine it's not a big deal. He says we can go again in a minute. I was like \"ok...\" I feel so goddamn awkward. And I again should have just left lol.\n\nInstead we sit on the bed in complete silence. He has a thousand yard stare on his face. Then he pops another beer (I've been there for maybe.... 20 min at this point) and says to me \"I just broke up with my girlfriend of 5 yrs last night\" and he then proceeds to tell me how he feels like he just cheated on her and how he doesn't think he can go again. I say \"OK, I'm gonna go\" and he grabs my arm and says \"No please don't go yet.\" Jesus fucking christ what have I gotten myself into. \n\nSo now this man is near tears as he's telling me about his ex girlfriend and how they broke up last night, he slept at a friends house, made a tinder and matched with me. Then his ex texted him that she wanted him to come home and work it out. THIS MORON FUCKING TOLD HER HE WAS MEETING UP WITH ME. Said \"I thought we were done so I made tinder plans\" and she of course responded with a \"Well we're done now\". AND THEN he has the AUDACITY to text her when he got to the room that he was there and that she needed to tell him not to do this. She responded as any woman would and said \"Do what you want.\" His reasoning was he felt bad for canceling on me. Of which I reminded him I was just a tinder whore and honestly would have been just fine at home with my vibrator. \n\nRemember when I said the moral of the story is, 'It gets worse'? Yeah that time is now. She starts texting him while we are still naked in bed. He ignores her. So she then starts calling him. Over. And Over. And over again. He says he's going to block her. I say \"I'm going to go\" and he burst into tears. Full on sobbing. He yelled \"You didn't even finish!\" I gather my clothes quickly and run. I end up getting dressed in the hotel hallway. Luckily it wasn't a busy night and other than any security cameras, no one saw me. I get into the elevator and I just laugh the entire way to my car.\n\nIt's an absolutely horrid tinder experience, but a really fun story to tell. I have since had a very successful ho phase, and have significantly higher standards. I doubt I'll ever have a worse experience, but never say never lol.", "My ex and I were both in our early 20‚Äôs. We were having sex in his room and his mom came in and told us to cover up with the blanket.

Found out later that not only was I the second person she ever had sex with, it was her second time.\n\nI ended up staying voluntarily celibate for 10 years afterward bc I was so ashamed of myself.

The whole time he was distracted she would hear me because he wasn't allowed to bring girls home, he had terrible breath and it took forever for him to finish. When he did, it was a little squeak like a mouse.

The risk of infection is greater in the urethra since it does not have a large microbiome* to kick out unwanted bacteria, unlike the vagina, which has its own healthy microbiome. That said, oral can still give a woman a vaginal infection if the person giving head has a mouth infection (such as thrush, an overgrowth of Candida), doesn't regularly brush or floss, or has an STD (which can be present in the mouth).\n\nTLDR?
