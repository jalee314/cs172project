A tiny pin prick of light would fly into view in the sky, and stop dead above our house. I‚Äôd then be overcome with utter fear. Suddenly, there would be ghosts with huge black eyes floating outside my window making really stereotypical ‚Äúwooooooo‚Äù noises. \n\nSomehow they‚Äôd get into my room so I‚Äôd jump up out of bed and run towards my bedroom door, but it would feel like I wasn‚Äôt able to run, or like I was being pulled back. Eventually I‚Äôd make it onto the landing and pulling on the bannister, I‚Äôd get downstairs. By the time I was along the hallway, there would be a bigger creature like a demon or something floating towards me which had made it into the house.\n\nI‚Äôd get into the living room, and either a) it was empty, or b) my parents were there, and despite all the screaming, they‚Äôd be oblivious to me either staring at the tv, or just sitting expressionless. \n\nThis big demon thing would get me, and drag me up the stairs and then out the window and into the sky. \n\nNext, I‚Äôd be in a huge cylindrical room with a weird tortoise shell wall texture which was oily or greasy.  \nIn the middle of the room would be a podium or stand, and someone standing on it who I called the witch. \n\nShe would tell me she was going to ask me three questions, but I‚Äôd always get the first one wrong, then a hatch would open beneath me and I‚Äôd fall. (I don‚Äôt remember the question)\n\nSuddenly I‚Äôd wake up in bed. \n\nI had this repeatedly for 7 years before I told them to leave me alone in the dream.

Said mummies came back to life and promptly ate me and another kid for dinner, Imhotep (that one priest from 1999 The Mummy movie) style. You know how he absorbs the eyeballs off of one poor sap? Yeah, just like that.\n\nThe other dream was like a Night at the Muesum/Zoo Tycoon crossover on drugs.

The bullets they had went right through the cement block walls and I remember just trying so hard to find a way out of that building and being so scared.  I woke up before my dream self made it out and I was a mess.\n\nThis was before Columbine, and I was lucky that I didn't go to school in a time where this was such a real threat.

I have a tenth of mile drive and my home cannot even be seen from the highway. I usually had to go outside to make a call.\nAs a child I used to dream that there was fire all around the ceiling of a bedroom where my brother and I used to sleep in bunkbeds.  I was waiting for the ceiling to fall.  My parents were consciencious.  For example there was a ladder that could be hung and unraveled from from an upstairs window.\nAfter my home fire on Friday, I stayed with a male friend in his home at first.

I remember there being a huge hole in the kitchen that leaf into a graveyard of sorts. \n\nWhen i was 18, my friends and i were dicking around and went walking down this abandoned road. The fucking house was there. I shit you not, ive had premonitions my whole life but this was anxiety inducing fear. They all knew about it too, i was very open about my dreams  as a kid. They decide to go in, i follow because im scared to be outside alone. Its fucking identical, same way i came in through the window, the long hallway that lead left to living room, right to kitchen. The fucking family portraits were so old and unsettling, i mean the house was a decrepit mess. Everything, every detail, identical, so i really start to panic. \n\nMy friend Q says I'll go with you into the kitchen, there's a large piece of cardboard in the middle of the floor and i beg them not to step on it. They move it, lo and behold a fucking hole into hell in the center of the kitchen. They all looked at me and we fucking bolted. It was seriously awful.\n\n\nI'd say second was a dream i had about these two boys that went to my old highschool. My junior year i had to move, so i wasn't around them anymore. I had a dream they were in a black truck driving too fast on a wet, dark, rainy road. I watched them die. \n\nA week later i get a call from one of my old friends saying J and H got into a car accident, one died on the scene and the other is in ICU. I asked her to tell me exactly what happened, and obviously i collapsed in full blown panic attack. J survived, i even saw him at graduation and he and i both shared a deep moment of understanding.

It was eerie considering my dreams of planes falling from the sky", "Not the hatman. That mf scares me to this day.", "That sounds very scary. Did you ever find out why or what happened.", "I mean, looking back on it. I still don't get why. I haven't had one in years, and for some reasonz I don't find it that intense? Idk.", "No, im lucky that it‚Äôs only happened twice though. For some people it‚Äôs a common occurrence. A lot of people have visual/audible hallucinations while it‚Äôs happening too. For me I woke up, fully conscious and aware of my surroundings but I couldn‚Äôt move, struggled to breathe a little bit. (Prob due to anxiety) kinda had to will myself out of it. Why it happens, Basically, your brain wakes up while your body is still in deep sleep mode."]}

If we couldn't get it quickly enough, she'd make comments like \"how did your dad and I who are so smart have such stupid kids?\" or \"how can you not know this? It's so easy.\" She used to call us worthless, useless, stupid, dumb, etc. whenever she was mad and she had very little patience in teaching us anything. Dad would teach us on the side but as a result I could never do mental math cuz I'd freeze up and just draw blank in my head. \n\nAs an adult, I disassociated very hard when needing to do mental math of any kind. I would involuntarily tear up really hard too whenever someone would ask me math questions. I never realized how bad it was until my bf pointed it out last year how that wasn't normal and it was a trauma response. My boyfriend, who is ungodly patient, drilled me and still challenges me to do mental math to help me overcome the trauma. There was one time I disassociated so hard that I became a husk of myself. He said it looked like he was watching a little kid version of me while I swung my legs back and forth while sitting, using all my strength just to mutter \"yes\" or \"no\" in the most monotonous tone. All I remembered from that experience was me trying to escape into the depths of my brain where it felt safest and riding it out until it was over. It just looked gray and foggy to me. He kept telling me he believed in me and that I can take my time to answer. He guided me step by step until I got the answer myself, but it must have taken at least an hour for us to get there. We were doing percentages of large even numbers, nothing crazy. \n\nI don't tear up anymore when I'm asked math questions. And my boyfriend has taught me different patterns and tricks on finding the fastest way to add numbers together. I still have to practice holding the numbers in my head, but doing mental math feels rewarding now and sometimes even a bit exciting knowing I can get the answer right.

I must have filled it out wrong tho lol or my mom just convinced them to do it anyways because we came back another day, like a Friday night maybe? I kind of blocked it out. I remember it was in the evening. I remember being in the basement with this whole group of adults and they had some sort of worship/ prayer session then started their exorcism crap on this one lady who started talking in this crazy voice, like the stuff you see in movies.

I'd gotten an associates degree HVAC in 2008 and nobody was hiring. I had been bartending a few days a week and working as a part time \"helper\" at a heating and cooling outfit for 8 bucks an hour since, but was mostly partying and crashing at my parent's house.\n\nOut of desire to get some independence, I applied and landed an apprenticeship for a local manufacturer that was notorious for good pay and 60 hour weeks. Shortly after I started, my remaining great grandparent died and their house was to be auctioned as part of the estate. \n\nI spent a lot of time with said great grandparents as a teen. They were *interesting* people and I was always looking for an excuse to go burn one, so i'd go for a drive with my one hitter, then stop in to bs/see if they needed anything done around the house.  \n\nWhen the auction day came, my mom asked if I was going to bid on the house. It seemed like an impossible concept at the time, but the more I asked the better the idea seemed. I did some back of the envelope math and decided I would bid up to 70,000 and figure out the rest from there.\n\nI won the auction at 63,000 and became a homeowner. Owner of a home that was built in the 1920s and needed EVERYTHING. I started the decade+ process of first making it livable, then making it a home.  \n\nI was working 55 hours a week, going to class 6 hours a week, and constantly in the middle of a major diy project for the entirety 4 years. New siding, all new plumbing, new roof, sanded and finished the 1920s pine, took out a wall, new HVAC, installed a 200a service, and on and on. It seems like a fever dream and I don't know how I did it, but the parts I do remember are ones of satisfaction and purposeful fulfillment. Biting off way more than I can chew and navigating my way through the challenges made me a different person. I gained confidence in my abilities as well as comfort in recognizing my limits in ability and capability. \n\nPlus, I have a home, and it's my home. Every room is filled with meaning. My daughter's bedroom is the same room my great grandpa used to hide quarters under the rug for me to find as a toddler. The marriage proposal to my out-of-my-league wife is still painted on the wall of our bedroom (under glass with a frame) through multiple changes in color and decor. It means the world to me.\n\nAs an investment, i could sell it for 10x what I paid at auction going by sales around me, but it's irrelevant. This isn't a starter home, it's a finisher home....

I started painting graffiti around age 15 and it consumed my life for many years. I was chased many times by the police, but always got away. Prior to painting a spot we would have multiple get a way routes planned. Furthermore, we would wear earth colored shirts (brown, gray, etc) and would have white t-shirts underneath so if a chase ensued and we got away, we would change into the white shirts to look different. We also would wear police sweatshirts, and try and dress as nerdy as possible for certain missions. \n\nThe craziest chase that occurred happened when I was 18, and painting an abandoned building with some friends. It was around 12 am, and a full moon in an abandoned industrial area. This spot was considered \"chill\" because there was no one around and the area was deserted. Anyways my buddy did a throw-up on a wall on the seventh story in a part of the building that was partially collapsed so you could see the throw-up from the ground. Shortly after, an older man we painted with told us to get down. We didn't know why, but he had spotted a police car that was about 1/2 a mile away. This man had a police sense like no other. We decided to head down and start to go back to our car, as the police car made us feel sketchy about the situation. \n\nAfter exiting the abandoned building we needed to walk about 300 feet on an abandoned foundation that was about 6 feet off the ground in order to get to an opening in the fence. As we walked on the foundation all of a sudden a spot light lit us up. My friends jumped off the foundation and started to run to the left. I knew that if I ran to the right, I had an escape route planned, so I headed in that direction. I got to the hole in the fence, and I saw a police officer coming around the corner with a flash light. He was about 20 feet away and was about to shine it on me, so I decided to bolt. He chased me through an abandoned parking lot, and then a police cruiser came skidding in, with spot lights on me, and the officer jumped out. I bolted down an abandoned train track and started to make my get-away. However, as I ran, more police started to run down through a yard after me. There were about 5 officers chasing me on foot now, but I was very fast (I ran track) and I kept moving. There was a river on my left, and woods on my right, and about 1 mile ahead there was a neighborhood I could run into and get away. As I continued down the tracks, I gained a considerable distance on the police, and was breathing easy, however I then noticed police were coming towards me now. I had no choice but to enter the woods on my right. As I ran up through the woods, I noticed a police cruiser pull up at a house about 1/4 mile away and started to shine lights into the woods. I had no choice but to climb into a bush and lay low. That's when I heard the dogs barking and saw the police dogs running around. After about an hour a police boat pulled up into the river and started to search the bank. A helicopter then started to circle. I stayed in that bush until 4:30 am when the sun started to come out. The police that were shining the light into the woods had left and if I stayed I would 100% get arrested so I got up and went through the woods to a neighborhood, and then changed into my white T-shirt. Somehow I walked back to my car and drove off and got home around 5:30 am covered in cuts and scratches. A few days later I returned looking like a nerd with my girlfriend (now wife) to collect my supplies I ditched. While getting the supplies a police officer pulled up and told us to be careful because someone was kidnapped a few nights before at that location.
