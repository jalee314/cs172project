When people show you who they are, believe them.\"", "Well, for one, cut things off earlier.\n\nNot at the 4th or 5tg feed flag incident, at the 1st.\n\nI was single for like, 7 years, didn't really see anyone for more than a few months, nothing serious. Because I refuse to disrupt my peace for anyone. If you don't add to my life, come in create problems, you gotta go. \n\nAnd a lot of the ways to avoid that, is to cut people off in dating phase at the first real red flag. \n\nI'm dating a wonderful guy now, but I told him a lot of things of front. One great example being that of he EVER, even once, yelled at me, we were done (like in anger, you know, the fighting kind of yelling, because I don't do that. We can disagree, but I will not tolerate yeing, insults, etc). Almost 3 years now and not a single fight. Some disagreements sure. Even 1 or 2 disagreements where we had to step back, take a break to gather ourselves and return to it 15 minutes later. But not a single fight. No yelling, not ever. \n\nAnd people don't really get it when I say that I will do a potential partner SO FAST,  but it's because of things like that. Because I've gotten really good at seeing when a free flag is actually indicative of a larger pattern of behavior that I want nothing to do with. Insecurity, jealousy, controlling, those kinds of things, just nope. And as soon as I see any of that, I nope out immediately. \n\nThe last dude I saw firing that long mostly single period, I \"dated\" for maybe a few weeks. Until he came over to my place one night with some juice in hand (the kind you add alcohol too), that he'd been sipping in while driving over. I didn't make a big deal, didn't even say anything, just kinda stopped taking too him after that. Coz of you're willing to drink while driving to my place... yeah, I'm all set on that. \n\nDon't try to change anyone, don't make a fuss, just have very strict standards about the behavior you're willing to tolerate and nope out at the first red flag. \n\nAnd pay attention to your gut instincts. It's they do something that makes you really uncomfortable but you can't pinpoint exactly WHY, who cares about the why, nope out anyway. Because you were uncomfortable, and that's enough reason. \n\nYou don't need a \"good reason\" to not date someone.   All you need is to feel like you don't want to be with them. Because that feeling should tell you everything you want to know. \n\nAnd even that I hold to.  If I'm ever seeing someone and they come over and I have that \"man, I can't wait for you to leave\" or \"I would be enjoying this thing (whatever we're doing) so much more if i was alone\" feeling, or even if I fell like I'd just rather be by myself then have that person there and have to entertain them, then I'm done. Coz something inside me, for whatever reason, is very clearly telling me that I would be happier alone. So I listen, and I go back to being alone. \n\nHelps that I really enjoy myself. I love slending time with me, I'm great company, and I amuse myself to no end. But it also means that I date less people who just aren't the right fit because I quickly recognize when something isn't for me. \n\nAnd a relationship SHOULDN'T feel like an intrusion. Ideally, you want to find a companion, someone who compliments you and your life and fits into it well enough that you enjoy your life MORE for their presence in it. So if it's not that, I just don't do it. \n\nAnd with the guy I'm currently dating, that's always how it feels. Hes over an awful lot, but it never feels like he's intruding in my space, I never have to feel like I wish he'd just leave already. I like when he's around, I like that we can just hang out together and chill and I can be doing my own thing and he's doing his and its just comfortable. \n\nSo anyway, there's my very long winded advice, from someone who's on decent terms with all of their exes (and even to that point,  I don't count things that were never serious. I only consider a person an ex if we had an actual relationship that lasted like months and months or years.

Imagine I have to write something down. I pick up my planner and a pen. By the time I open the planner, I already don’t remember half of the information I was supposed to write down, because my brain reads “pick up planner and pen” as a task, it takes up the RAM or something. *I have a doctor’s appointment at uhhhh Thu- Thursday I guess. Yea I think they said Thursday. At… Fuck I don’t remember the time. * I’m guessing, I’m trying to recall what the nice lady on the phone said less than two minutes ago. 8:30? 9:30? Her voice echoes in my head but it echoes all the possible options, like, I’m imagining her voice saying “Your appointment with doctor Kirby is at 11:37” as well, and I don’t really know what option is true anymore. I am too embarrassed to call and ask again (because I already missed two appointments and I feel like a burden), so I grab my phone to google the clinic’s opening times. They open at 8. I’ll put 7:30 just in case. I put down my pho- oh fuck where’s my planner? It was right the fuck here a second ago. I have a pen but where’s my planner? I get up to check if I maybe stupidly put it under my ass but it’s not there. I try to remember if I maybe started walking around unconsciously while checking stuff on my phone. No fucking idea. I walk around looking for my planner, repeating “doctor at 7:30, doctor at 7:30, doctor at 7:30” out loud. I find the planner on my desk. Black fucking magic. I get pissed off and excited at the same time because I found my planner but how the fuck did it appear on the desk, like, I don’t remember even getting close to it. I don’t remember what I was supposed to put down in there tho. Fuck. FUCK. FUUUUCK. I’m just pure angry. I grab my phone to rant to my friend, I unlock the phone, I see that I was looking at clinic’s opening times, OH, RIGHT. DOCTORS APPOINTMENT. 7:30. I have my planner but where’s my goddamn pen now? No I can’t just grab my favourite pen, I need that exact pen because it’s my favourite pen and it’s the same pen that I signed my planner with so it needs to be the exact same pen because in all this fucking mess I’m still a perfectionist. That’s why I hate myself so much and why I get so easily suicidal when I’m not medicated. I look under my bed. No pen. I look under pillows, blankets, in my desk drawers, on the desk itself, under, at some point I even fucking forget what I’m looking for. It’s already quite late, I’m hungry, I need to go to bed. I eat a slice of cheese and a banana because I have no energy really to prepare a meal or even a sandwich, I’m pissed off and I don’t exactly know why anymore, just this fucking chaos.

Our mind just won't let us, even if we're hyper aware of the urgency of needing to do the thing and know the rationalization behind it. There have been times I have missed deadlines (despite knowing very acutely how important they are!) because I just freeze and my mind puts up a mental block in front of the execution stage, and I cannot do the thing. I am desperately aware I need to do the thing, and there are real life consequences if I don't do it. But I *can't* in that moment, and it's not something I control.

When you see someone in a wheelchair taking an elevator, do you ask them to explain why they can't take the stairs, even if they're just going up one floor and it's faster than waiting for the elevator? I'm guessing not, because you assume it has something to do with why they're in the wheelchair. When others can't see what's going on with another person's body, they tend to gaslight them, or interrogate them about what they're doing wrong, or ask for rationalizations about why we function the way we do as if you are deciding whether our answers are valid. I say this with the utmost warmth and respect: you don't have to understand why someone can't do something that you have the ability to do. The answer is my disability won't let me. That answer is valid enough. \n\n\nAnd please understand that when I am struggling to do something that a neurotypical person can, I am also frustrated with myself that I can't do the thing. You are not alone in your frustration with me; I hate myself in that moment, too. ADHD can result in feeling a lot of shame, embarrassment, resentment, and self-loathing strictly *because* we know we are fucking up something that is really easy to do for others. But that doesn't mean we can all of the sudden just do it. If we were able to just function like neurotypicals, then we wouldn't be disabled. ", "Man.

However, I would say the awareness those trendy videos have is actually a good thing because it DOES legitimize some of our struggles and sometimes someone has one of those lightbulb moments where they realize that describes how their brain works.

Since the start of my condition which came about after a workplace injury, I describe to my therapist and psychiatrist what I call \"the Wall\" I can't get through the wall.  They ask me what I mean and I try to describe that I know what needs to be done in a situation and know how to do it, and I even know that getting it done is becoming an urgency but I can't get through The Wall to actually do it.  I try, and I just can't whether it is a paper, an email, cleaning, cooking, the cat box, laundry, a work project; there is just no ability to focus or concentrate on the project.  the motivation is there, i WANT to do, but I just....can't.\n\nI tell them how I can sit and look at it and I just tell myself, \"Thad, just hit respond and type a three sentence reply, its that freakin' easy bud\" but I can't.  Or when I was in University and had to write a paper, I'd have a month to do it, and I just couldn't, until the very night before it was due.  Urgency and emergency limits could trip the 'get it done' motivation, but fuck, it is so many simple things in life.\n\nThe Dr. and therapist asked if this was new and said, no it has been my whole life, and I described how progressive and productive I could be if I didn't have the fight the wall on so many different things wasting so much energy when if I had just done the thing i would have saved 4/5s of that energy and worry.\n\nAll they have said is asked if I'd like to try a drug for it.  I asked them which ones and two of the three I had already tried for the depression and they didn't help with the wall, so I said no, and they didn't/wouldn't pursue it any further.  It is frustrating.  I then read threads like this and get pissed off because I see others going through nearly exactly what I am feeling, and it has a name but because I am older, they don't take it seriously.  They ask, well how did you get through life then?  Well, it was hella hard, you become experts at using reasons and excuses and become a very good manipulator to achieve what your wall won't let you do through pure effort.", "Find a doctor who is an ADHD specialist.

I think metrazapine is a *TeCA*) and I recently got a medical lisence for medical cannabis to try and help with the ADHD whilst I go through diagnosis (waiting list in the UK is crazy long even with right to choose).\n\nI think both Metrazapine and Buproprion are considered atypical antidepresants so it could be that they let me switch, we'll see. Thank you for the suggestion, I appreciate it dude :) \n\n  \nHonestly it's the executive disfinction that I need help with the most. I'm about 2 months off from my consultation with the ADHD clinic and I cannot wait.

I am adding some info just in case anyone reading is like “shit I can’t afford that”, there are sometimes other options. \n\nSo testing (as in a full neuropsych eval) can be very helpful. But also, there is no standard “adhd test”. Also, many adhders are great at tests- we can focus bc it is a novel and rewarding environment. So many of us do the testing and our case is misdiagnosed. \n\nThis info applies to the US: so, some insurance requires testing. Some does not. Testing is important if someone is in school, it is necessary to qualify for an IEP (public school accommodations). As an adult, it is important to get testing if a) it is complex (like your wife’s combined diagnosis) or b) if your insurance requires it.\n\nIf your insurance does not require it, or if you are paying out of pocket, you can often see a psychiatrist (hopefully one who specializes in adhd- surprisingly hard to find, given how common the disorder is), and get evaluated through diagnostic interview. This might take a couple sessions. This is useful (and part of a neuropsych eval) because it tracks your real life symptoms, not just how you perform in a testing environment (for example, I can easily rotate shapes in my mind during a test, but I can’t remember to reply to important emails, and the latter is what really matters in practical terms). Taking this path of diagnosis, out of pocket expenses will be far lower than doing the full battery of neuropsych testing. \n\nAgain, some psychiatrists or insurance will require testing. But ones who specialize in ADHD often will not, bc they know the testing does not adequately measure the whole picture of executive dysfunction. \n\nAgain, definitely not saying you guys wasted money, at all. It sounds like that was the right thing to do in a complex case. Just wanted to out these other options out there in case anyone is struggling but can’t shell out 3k. Getting adequate care and diagnosis is difficult, and involves all the things we are bad at, plus it’s very unclear, so I hope this info helps someone!", "I was diagnosed when I was in my early 30’s and man do I wish I had been sooner.

But she’d show up occasionally with her friend, and I’d let her hang out at my place, and although I had several friends who would come by to drink/party, I never supplied her with anything except soda. \n\nWhen I parked in front of her place she leapt over to the drivers seat and straddled me, grinding on me and kissing me, telling me how much she wanted me, and demanded to know why I hadn’t ever made a move on her. We continued to make out in my car for a while. It was a very nice surprise, she was an excellent kisser, and it had been a while since anybody had kissed me that passionately. \n\nThere was no way we were going to have sex in the car, or at her place, even though it was obvious by the way she was grinding on me that she was extremely horny (She was living with her grandparents while going to college). \n\nI bid her goodnight, as she turned to go, she said she was going to take a shower, I jokingly told her not to wear out the shower-head. It took her a second to process what I said, and she froze in place, like a deer caught in the headlights, then demanded to know how the hell I knew she was planning on using the shower head to masturbate, and wanted to know if I’d been spying on her while she showered. \n\nI was like, “I didn’t even know where you lived before I drove you home just now!Remember, you just gave me turn by turn directions to get here.” (It was about a 20 minute drive from my place). So she was like, “Then how did you know about the shower head?” I just laughed, and said “I’ve had girlfriends before, and it was just a guess”.\n\nWe did have sex at my place in the following days. One day she stopped by and I wasn’t home, so she left a note on a beer bottle label, and stuck it to my back door, telling me how much she loved my dick. I never used the back door, so I didn’t find the note… my mom did when she stopped over and used the back door to get into get in. That was awkward, because my mom handed me the note when I got home, and chided me for it.

Well we leave the restaurant and she stops me getting into the SUV and said, “hold on, let’s get in the back seat, I want to show you something.” And then she kissed me with such passion and pinched my nipples that it was instant hard on. Then she gave me my first ever blowjob where she deep throated me and licked my balls with her tongue while she was all the way down. I never had someone do that to me before that I came right away and she gobbled it all up and then she kept going and kept holding that same position time and time again that it made me cum a second time a few minutes later. She literally sucked the soul out of my body that I could feel my soul leaving. She just loved to give blowjob and she was amazing at it. Then we eventually made our way to the park for the walk and she did it a couple of more times in the trees. I didn’t have a soul for days. The next date we hooked up at her place after and that was the first time a girl stuck her finger in my ass while she was riding me and I came right away from that too.

The three of us. Went at it a few times through the night. Finished in both of them at times and they cracked on while I recovered. Hell of a night.

Apparently, after divorce, she was seeking for the liberty she couldn't find in her conservative marriage life - she herself later put it that way, not me. \n\nAnyway, one evening, after a casual conversation at work about wine and wine testing, she texted me a photo of  a wine bottle and asked my opinion. I am a wine enthusiast and responded with my opinion on that particular wine. My nerdy side ignored the time of the message (it was pretty late at night) and kept talking about wine and wineyards around us. At some point in our conversation, she invited me to her place to have it together. I grabbed another good bottle at home, got in a cab, and went to her place around 1.00 A.M. When she opened the door, she was already in her underwear, and she looked smoking hot with all her messy hair. She welcomed me with a kiss. I was super shocked and turned on with her confidence level. She acted like knew she was hot. We both know we'd have intimacy that night, but she was chill, and we had no rush. We started with her bottle and chatted a little casually, we put on some songs to set the mood. Then, she asked to taste the wine I brought. I served it and asked her opinion. \nAt this point, where I thought nothing could beat the sexyness of being welcomed by a crush in her underwear, she left her glass, grabbed the bottle, and while looking me in the eye, she said \"Do you see this bottle? Imagine, this is you.\" Then she performed an intense blow job on the bottle with deep throating and everything for at least 3-4 mins straight (she even gagged on the bottle). I was super turned on bcs she kept eye contact with me throughout and finished with a huge sip of the wine. After that, she said \"This is my opinion, do you like it?\" Then we started dancing with the bottle in our hand, and I unhooked her bra, kissed and foreplayed.

It was all going super well for about 4 months, then it kinda all fell apart in sequence in different ways.\n\nSchedules changed for the person I was seeing sparsely just for fun, we lived quite far from each other so it just wasn't practical anymore. Sad, but fine.\n\nThe other person I was dating wanted to end things as it felt like they had run their course, I actually agreed. We were kinda being pulled in different directions, so that was fine as well. But did leave me with only goth lady, which made me both a bit vulnerable and also a bit needy/dependant on someone who was also dating a second guy.\n\nTbf before that she'd also been a bit... aloof when she wasn't physically with me. But when she was with me, she very much seemed like she really liked me and trusted me. She asked me to do some intimate things that she didn't usually trust people to do, wanted to try more things, got excited at my ideas for fun outings we could do. They never really happened though... when she was gone I felt like I was constantly the one bothering her to do something, to see each other.\n\nI wasn't jealous of her other partner, but I didn't feel we were on equal footing, which is what we were supposed to be. But I didn't feel like it, so I, admittedly somewhat emotional at the time (I wasn't at my best at the time, depressed and, I now know, struggling with undiagnosed inattentive ADHD), asked to talk about what the hierarchy was and if we could establish a more consistent day we'd see each other.\n\nShe reassured me we were equal and agreed to a day a week we'd always do something. That day came the next week and she had plans with her other boyfriend and his friend. They'd been plans since before our chat, but she didn't mention it or work around it. I got upset and said it just doesn't feel like I'm equal here, if that's so, its okay, I just need to know, I need you to be honest with me.\n\nSo she was and told me 'I just wasn't that important to her'. Absolutely crushed me. I replied saying I think I deserved to be treated better than this, with more honesty and I found that statement confusing considering how she was when she was with me. She didn't reply for 6 months.\n\nWhen she did, she said she'd been through some stuff, family member had passed and it had been hard. Didn't say sorry, didn't really acknowledge that she'd hurt me, didn't mention her other man. I was nice, gave her sympathy and said I'm around if you want to talk, but I'll give you some more space. Month or so later I realised I was still hanging on, secretly hoping she'd come back, and that I needed to draw a line under it.\n\nSo I sent her a message saying I appreciate she'd been through some sucky things, that she has her own issues and that I wasn't always at my best, but that I think she hurt me far more than I really deserved. For my own wellbeing I needed to express my feelings and not just sit here hoping you'd come back. I said this wasn't me locking the door on you, but I am closing it and its up to you to open it again if that's what you want.\n\nThen I deleted her number. She never did open that door again. Eventually I got over it, but hell I think that was the most I've ever actually been hurt by a romantic partner. Most of my other breakups were just things changed or they'd felt like I was clocking out of the relationship, which was usually correct. Again, the undiagnosed ADHD probs played a part in that, but while I didn't know why I did it, I was aware I was. I could accept those reasons easily, but this one... I just didn't really understand and I was absolutely smitten with her still, so it cut me right to my core.\n\nThere's some more to it, mostly around her queer identify. She hurt me deeply, but I don't hate her. I honestly hope she figures herself out at some point. It's a shame I got hurt in the process, but I've learned form it too.

It's not about wealth it's just beautiful to look at, the combination of terraced hills, architecture, palm trees and the density of creative people, hipsters, and  culture is sort of magical.

Movies were a magical business and it was a city where anything could happen. ANYTHING.\n\nEspecially when we were in our 20s.

Got some inheritance and decided fuck it, I'm gonna move there for 2 months. I loved living in Manhattan, I loved walking across the block for pizza, living above a bar and an empanada shop, walking everywhere, small semi-weekly grocery runs since my tiny apartment had the world's tiniest kitchen. Constant stream of the best food I've ever had, amazing little shops and communities, some of the best memories of my life. I loved the busyness, the constant road noise, nonstop lights, things to do, people around, things to see, new things to try. I felt like I lived a whole lifetime in those two months. \n\nIt was also immensely lonely-- partially because I only lived there for a short time, so I didn't bother making any connections. I felt very isolated without a car, as someone who grew up in Appalachia and drove everywhere constantly-- it was easy to feel trapped with no real way to easily leave the city. It was also ungodly expensive. Tiny studio apartment was as much as my current entire house, and I love having belongings, so it would cost at least 5 grand a month (for just rent) to have a decent sized place. \n\nIf my salary doubled tomorrow, I'd move back in a heartbeat. It's a hefty price tag to live the Manhattan life, but I'd choose it in an instant if I could.", "Wanted to live in Seattle since I was 11, when Nirvana hit it big and I learned about the scene, I knew that’s where I wanted to be. \n\nBeen here for 25 years and it’s exactly the place where I wanted to live.", "Not a city, but I definitely romanticized the hell out of New England before I moved here...it's been 4 years now and I still can't imagine living anywhere else.

Living here I care more about safety and the healthcare system and work-life balance (which by the way is way better than it was in America, for me at least). Never experienced racism when I came as a tourist but Living here for 2 years so far, ohh it's definitely a thing. I don't let it get to me. Also the extremely hierarchical society is weird af for me, but I've noticed it mostly in bars and restaurants.     \n\nOne example: A business owner can harass a customer or an employee (words, violence like punching them or sexually, like just grabbing their tits) and the employee can't say anything.     \n\n Obviously not a total generalization but I feel like the amount of times I've seen it here, that shit would not fly in America.       \n\nI did mention safety is awesome here but the organized crime and scams here do run rampant and you can get totally fucked if you don't have common sense and be careful     \n\nBut overall my life here is amazing, I have no regrets", "I moved to NYC right out of college.

Still enjoy visiting NYC, though.", "NYC is a horrible trash pile full of human garbage and I will NEVER leave.", "I moved from a small town to my dream city back to my small town and I wish I stayed in my dream city except for family ", "I was like this with London. I studied abroad there while I was in college and still loved the city and the experience even more than I had expected, but the isolation and separation from my loved ones affected my mental health and I struggled with disordered eating.\n\nI came back 10 years later with my husband on my honeymoon and it was perfect. I guess the conclusion is that London is a great city, but it’s better if you know somebody there, because it’s easy to feel lonely in a crowd. I’d often go days without speaking to anyone when I lived there.", "As a kid I grew up in a small city, tallest building was 10 stories and I was fascinated by cities like NYC, Tokyo, Hong Kong, etc.\n\nI eventually moved to Tokyo, been here for over 10 years and absolutely love it. I complain about things every now and then but deep inside I know I could never live anywhere else.", "I “fetishized” moving to London, England. It was fantastic and one of the best things I ever did", "I was born in a small Australian town - talking <500 people, with a school cohort in the double digits. Everyone knew everyone. Last I checked, Main Street looks the same as when I was a kid.\n\nMy cousins lived in Sydney, and I fetishised that city HARD. I was also a kid when the city went through a cultural revolution during the Sydney Olympics, then Finding Nemo came out and it seemed to experience another wave of global interest… my sleepy town of one lone Main Street couldn’t hold hold a candle to Big, Beautiful Sydney.\n\nSome 20 years later I’m accepted into Sydney University, so I move there.\n\nFirst morning I wake up from my expensive, shoebox-sized student sharehouse, swing my legs off the couch, and crush a HUGE cockroach with my bare foot. \nIt ‘pops’, right up the cuff of my pyjama pants. Things felt like they went downhill from there, I laugh now that it felt like a foreshadowing of my experience to come.\n\nI learned proximity to people doesn’t equate to *closeness* between people. \nMost Sydneysiders seemed rather insular and lonely. Locals are quite cliquey, and you either need to have gone to school with someone or be dating them to break into friendship groups.\nPeople have decided they don’t have time, I distinctly remember the day I was walking along City Rd/Broadway and I began walking faster, because I kept being overtaken by other walkers. Your nervous system feels hyped up all the time.\n\nI also learned how hard money speaks. Sydney was like a playground for the wealthy, and if you didn’t fit in or afford to live east of the ‘Latte Line’ you were in for a pretty rough time.\n\nSydney Uni also treated me like a student number, not an individual. Worked my ass off though, and won one of their prestigious medals. Still no acknowledgment from the faculty I studied, though 😂\n\nAll that said, I am so glad I lived there. I did meet my husband there, and the city is full of heritage and charm. We just prefer visiting now, I would never choose to live there again.", "I idolized Portland, OR as the perfect city. I grew up on the east coast and so in the closet, even I didn't figure it out until 24 years old. I love the rain and grey days, and I kept hearing that Portland was a food town, and I worked in food service so it just felt like it would be the perfect fit for me. Then in 2018, my now-husband and I packed up the car with $2000 in cash and some prepaid hotel rooms a long the way, and drove across the US to move to Portland. \n\n\nNow, I regularly just randomly say \"I'm so glad we moved to Portland,\" because I'm so much happier than I ever was back east. I feel like I really started my adult life because the minimum wage and cost of living get sort of close to matching. I felt stable enough to get married and change my career path. There are some very valid criticisms of the city, both of the government and the population, but I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.", "Wanted to live in Vegas, so when my then girlfriend suggested we move there I was more than excited. We arrived, found work, then… I hated it. Not going shit on people who enjoy the city, but it just wasn’t for me. Visiting to party and have fun is very different from living there.", "I see a lot of positive opinions here, so I'll toss in a negative one.\n\nMoved to NYC from the suburbs for 2 years, decided it wasn't for me. Of course, there are so many things in the city you can't find anywhere else. The food, entertainment, arts, museums are all top-notch.   \nBut everything is so expensive, the air is smelly/dirty year-round, there's random puddles of piss and piles of trash everywhere, and it's also absolutely exhausting just doing everyday tasks unless you're rich. You can either haul a bunch of groceries home on foot every week, or pay for delivery and hope they get your order right. Haul your laundry to the laundromat down 4 flights of stairs every week, or pay for laundry service or a luxury apartment with a built-in washer/dryer. Need a simple pair of folding chairs for guests to sit in? Have fun hauling it on the train, down the street, and up your stairs. The supermarkets also feel understocked compared to the big-box grocery stores of the suburbs, which I guess makes sense when you factor in literal space availability. In the suburbs I could just make one stop for everything I needed for the next week. In the city I'd have to go to a supermarket and then a Target to find some specific items, or - you guessed it - pay for delivery. Also, the \"city that never sleeps\" is a myth. I was surprised by how little was open past 10pm, and this was *before* Covid.", "I’m an Aussie with a British father so I have a British passport. I’d never been to London or New York but I got a job offer for a multinational that have offices everywhere and they wanted me to start asap in America. \n\nWe talked options and American visas being what they are looked like the long option - starting in London and “commuting” to the NY client was immediate due to the British citizenship. I jumped on an airplane and landed in London with a backpack and a job. \n\nI lived in London and spent a lot of time in NYC for around a decade. What I felt was that I’d gotten out of a small pond and I’d jumped in the largest stream possible, the stream of the world if you will. It was sooooo much more than I’d expected. Every interest, niche, fetish, hobby etc had its group of people. No one was really ostracised because they just had to find their thing and thus their people. \n\nI loved it and would still be there but for the pandemic and aging parents. \n\nOne anecdote I’ll leave you with was the cab rides from London Heathrow and New York’s JFK airports the first time I visited both cities. \n\nWhen I jumped in the NY cab the driver said to me “Welcome to the greatest city in the world, nowhere is better”. I asked him where else he’d travelled to, to which he said “I’ve never been anywhere else - why would I leave”. \n\nWhen I jumped in a black cab at Heathrow I told the cabbie it was my first time in London and he said “Why’d you come to this shit hole? I wish I could go somewhere else”. \n\nI was sad to leave London, I was pretty happy to leave New York. Both cities are amazing but London is the centre of the stream for my things.", "The first time I visited NYC I was in the city just under 24 hours and fell in love. Moved here the January after 9/11 and have been here ever since. It’s home.", "Moved to Philly a few years ago after only having visited once, 15 years prior. I loved the energy and vibe of the place then, and I always thought it would be fun to live there. When it was time to move somewhere new years later, we chose to give Philly a try, and my husband had never stepped foot here. \n\nNo regrets. We love it. I just wish we had come here sooner.", "This thread is making me so sad, because there’s a city I want to move to so bad and I’m sure I’ve romanticized it, but everyone is saying how their romanticized city was great and I can’t get out of the city I’m in because I can’t get another job in the city I want to.\n\nFuck, I’m just depressed.", "London, UK.\n\nI moved from a small city in the Netherlands to London at 19 with €1.000 cash, no savings, no back-up plan and no safety net back home.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, there was the endless red tape of getting a bank account set up, getting approved to work, getting an NHS number. Then there was the culture shock and how difficult it was to meet like-minded people and make friends. It took a good few years to settle and the more people suggested I return home, the more I was determined to make it work. One of the best decisions I ever made.\n\nOnce I got properly settled, I was working full-time and studying for a university degree part-time. I had a thriving social life and I couldn't imagine a better place to live in the whole world. London has music, arts, culture, architecture, history, nature, food unlike any other place. It is expensive and noisy and some places where I lived were dodgy to outright dangerous. But it was my city.\n\nAt one point I met my current partner while I was over in the Netherlands. We tried for him to get a job and to move to London also, but after a few years we decided it was best if I moved back. That was also a good decision as my salary raised significantly and I managed to get on the property ladder. But London will always be my special place. She is like no other.", "I've lived I LA for almost 9 years now, it's not a perfect city but it's perfect for me. I'm LGBT and knew there wasn't a future for me in my small Southern town - that, and I wanted to work in the film industry, so moving here was an obvious choice. There are so many more options than back home (actual public transit, cultural places/events, cool things to do) and I'm surrounded by people from a bunch of other cultures and countries. And the food is amazing!!! I might have to move away soon (lost my entertainment job and the industry is flatlining) and it's breaking my heart. I love my little corner of LA, I will be leaving a piece of my heart behind if I have to go.\n\n\nThat being said, I've always wanted to visit Tokyo and this thread is giving me FOMO ", "Reading all the comments from a suburban area is making me so sad and jealous as someone who wants to live in the city", "My ex was like this with Berlin.  We moved there together and it lived up to the hype.  It's certainly not for everyone, but it was definitely for us.  I'd never really thought much about the city before moving there, but would gladly move back some day.", "I lived in Tokyo for a year and loved it. I also grew up visiting fairly often and had dual citizenship which made some things easier.\n\nHowever, I don't like Tokyo much currently. Tourists are getting crazy and places like Shibuya are just way too busy to be enjoyable now imo.", "I was traveling to Chicago once a quarter for work and thought how cool it would be to live here. Moved after a few years and never looking back.", "Bali. \n\nI didn't nurse a fantasy for long. I first went there in Feb and returned to live there in May. But it is so different living there. Seeing the same people everyday mindlessly and automatically performing begging and pleading felt like swallowing stale food.  I saw the same routine and conformity in the constant religious offerings that are pretty but automated. I met lovely expats and locals but there's a stress in dealing with a constant tourism paradigm. I had business to do and at 3 months I knew I had to leave.

Growing up in a place like NYC and then moving to the States to realize that I actually enjoy suburb living", "London!! The culture, the different neighborhoods, the ART, the style, the museums, history, culture, it is a true melting pot. \n\nIt is expensive, there are challenges of course, and the visibility of wealth is staggering.

Moved on a job offer, would not go back to Cleveland any time soon.\n\nIt IS much sunnier here, there are still seasons for what that's worth, yes the mountains are nearby, no we are not directly in them.\n\nIt DOES have suburb hell all around it, downtown ain't great, I do really like where I live around cap hill though. It is much more walkable than other parts of the city. There are other cool neighborhoods that aren't super hard to get to.\n\nI don't drive, so public transit is a thing that needs improvement here.  It seems like projects to improve it start and stop based on weather, politicians, TABOR supporters, and the whims of some business owners.  \n\nI'd consider Boston (spent a few years there) or NYC, but I've already had enough great lakes and  New England weather for right now.\n\nAnyway, I really love it here, and it's fun reading the stories from everyone that loves where they live!", "I left a relationship partly because he wouldn’t move to Vancouver with me. \nIt was silly — I’d only visited twice — but I wanted to try BC so badly. \nIdk how I knew, but six years later I still adore this city. I’m sure I live in the best neighborhood in the country and I’m paying rent I never would have found if I’d waited longer to move.\nThere are a looottt of bad things about this city but I’m glad I followed my gut on it.", "I was certainly one of those individuals who envisioned that cities like Tokyo and New York City would be abuzz with excitement and glitz. But I found it's much more complex after relocating. The hustle in New York City is real; there is constant work, expensive rent, and a feeling of isolation even though there are millions of individuals there. While Tokyo was comparable and in fact stunning, it was hard to form true connections because of language issues. City living isn't the Instagram fantasy, but the magic remains. It is all about finding a balance between the hype and the reality.", "I fetishized Chicago. When I moved here right at the beginning of summer a couple years ago, I had the time of my life. I fell in love with the city through its parks, live music scene, and excellent food options. I feel so spoiled living here.

And loved it.  It's a great city.\n\nI moved there 5 days after graduation.  Stayed for 11 years, then got wanderlust and moved around the country for a decade.  Then, after all that, I decided that Seattle was home after all.  So 3 years ago I came back.  I only regret the decade I spent away from here.\n\nIs the region perfect?  No.  Is it home?  Yes.  Turns out I'm only a Midwest guy by birth, not by mindset.\n\n(Just to be clear, I'm referring to the Seattle Metro Area.  I've lived in Seattle proper and the suburbs; I'm mostly a suburban guy.

Also, medical care can be very frustrating and inefficient, and police are often not helpful at all if you ever need them for anything serious.", "This comment is pretty long, but I could make a much longer comment if I listed all the GREAT things about Japan.\n\nProblems: There are a number of things, but under a comparative lens to other places they are mostly negligible. Is there crime, of course. Will you encounter it? Most likely not and very rarely if so.\n\nIs there racism? Yeah, but not the blatant and dangerous hate I'm used to seeing in America. It's more underhanded. They hardly even have a concept of racism here, which is a problem.\n\nI'm a white guy, so that danger is mostly reserved for other people in the US, but being an outsider here I have gotten discrimination. I've been turned away from two different night time bars where they said \"Nihonjin dake\", which means Japanese people only. Not Japanese language only, Japanese PEOPLE only. So that sucks. That's incredibly rare though and usually only something you could encounter if you are slumming around for random drinking places at night in strange corners.\n\nIf you are coming from a country that has free healthcare, it will be a downgrade so to many that would be worth noting as a \"problem\", but coming from the US it's a massive upgrade. Also the quality of the care I've received has been top notch. I can finally afford to go to the doctor again and go frequently.\n\nThere are little annoyances here and there. The Japanese have no filter when it comes to talking about weight and they don't realize it hurts people's feelings when pointing out they are overweight. Also whether it's your school or your job, most places have you go do yearly physicals to check your health. It's weird to me a school does that. A bit annoying.\n\nPaperwork. My god there is a ton of paperwork for everything. It can be tedious. That said, taxes are way easier here to mess with than in the US. Fuck the US tax system.\n\nGay marriage, there is no gay marriage here. I consider that a problem. That said, I think they have the highest concentration of gay bars in the world in Nichome. Likewise I haven't seen any direct hate for transgender people here, but that doesn't mean people aren't weirded out, it's just a non-confrontational society. I know a few Japanese transgender people, one of which who has even had bottom surgery, two of which are business owners (bar). It probably helps that pronouns aren't used here much for anyone at all, so it isn't a point of argument and controversy. The Japanese people aren't being asked to change the way they speak about people to align with views they may disagree with.\n\nDrugs. Some would consider it a problem that weed isn't legal here. I think it should be, even if I don't enjoy it that much. A big plus about Japan is it doesn't have rampant drug problems. We have whole cities in America in the midst of epidemic where you can drive through it and people are sleeping standing up. Nothing like that in Japan. Drugs are present, but there is no epidemic here. The penalties are harsh.\n\nThat brings me to jail. Japanese imprisonment is insane. You're almost always solitary, no socializing. Before prison, you can actually be held for 23 days without a charge where they just slam accusations against you and pressure you to confess to something. It's why they have a 99 percent conviction rate. If you don't break the law, chances are you will never encounter this, but if you do, or put yourself in a situation that enables you to be abused, watch out. I generally avoid cops no matter what country I'm in. Also I never carry anything sharp no matter how harmless the intent. A skateboarder was harassed by law enforcement here for having a cutting tool for their grip tape.\n\nLoneliness. It can be tough to crack through the shell of a Japanese person and become a frequently spoken to friend. You will have a blast going out drinking or hanging out with them once or maybe twice, but unless they have an excuse to be around you like work or school, you can often find yourself getting ghosted.\n\nWhich brings me to dating: I've gotten ghosted a few times since I've been here. Sure it's a thing in the US too, but I feel it's more common here. I hate that.\n\nI'm sure there are other things, but mostly I just really really love living here.\n\nEdit: it can also be tough, (but absolutely doable), getting an apartment as a foreigner.\n\nEdit: And tattoos. Tattoos are fine but there are some gyms and bathhouses that won't allow you in if you have tattoos. It's a strict policy, it's over-correction to keep out Yakuza who historically had tattoos where most other non-crime related Japanese did not.\n\nEdit: work-life balance. It's an extremely overworked society, resulting in population decline. People aren't marrying and having babies. This is the first problem that comes to mind when most people think of Japan.", "It's actually pretty easy to navigate things there with google maps and google translator.

Turns out the town I moved to was celebrating its 60th anniversary. \n\nI’d say join in on public gatherings (if socially acceptable), and try to find stuff in common with some people there. Ask if there’s upcoming events that people are going to that you can join, and join in on ones that either sound interesting to you, or people that you mesh well with are attending. Stuff like concerts, board games, sports games, etc. where people can socialize. \n\nI’d also check places online to see if where you’re going to be moving to has groups like a subreddit, discord server, facebook group.

I’m glad you and your wife enjoyed it!", "Whew, this will be long! I don’t think I had a lot of “expectations” before moving here per se. I did end up visiting twice before moving, which definitely isn’t like living here, but it does give you a sense of certain things—the subway, walkability, diversity, homelessness, etc. So I knew all of those things already. I knew it was huge and vibrant with a lot of opportunities, diverse people and entertainment. I knew it was expensive and I’d have to have roommates, unfavorable living situations and really be frugal at first. I knew it’d take sacrifice. I also didn’t know anyone in NYC, so I knew I’d start out lonely. All of that was true. \n\nIn my 20s, I didn’t make much money. I lived with 2+ roommates and had to get creative with my fun. I ate one meal a day to save money. Fortunately, NYC offers a lot free entertainment and I made friends by getting creative. I subscribed to newsletters that listed out free and cheap things to do every week, and I explored as much on those lists as I could. I felt feverish all the time—always looking for something to do so I was almost never in my cramped apartment.\n\nOtherwise, I’d say that most of that time was full of normal 20s stuff — discovering myself, falling in and out of love and friendships, trying new hobbies. It’s just that so much MORE of everything is in NYC. Every type of person you could meet, every hobby you’d want to try, hundreds of ways to volunteer and be civically engaged, every weird to benign thing you want to explore. I’ve done things I’d never thought I’d do and had some really wild experiences. I ended up landing my dream job through someone I met at a free Shakespeare themed bar crawl. I remember one week where I attended a magazine party with celebrities for work, went to a Broadway show (Broadway lottery tickets were like $20 back then), went to a friend’s rooftop party in Brooklyn and chain smoked while looking at the Manhattan skyline, and then spent the weekend laying out at the beach (people often forget that NYC is on the ocean). I walked in the women’s march one morning and then dropped acid for the first time at a party that night. That sort of thing. It was the best time of my life so far. \n\nThen things really changed during COVID and I also got older. I started making more money and could finally live alone in a studio apartment, but my rent has increased 35% over four years so even though I make six figures now, I can’t afford to move out of my studio. Things close earlier and there are fewer 24 hour things. The city is still bustling, but not quite with the same energy as before. A lot is commercialized because locally owned stores and restaurants can’t afford their rents. I know that I’ll probably never own my own property unless I end up marrying someone wealthy. That weighs on me a bit, especially because dating in NYC is so challenging and I’m still single at 33. \n\nBut none of that is to say I’m unhappy here—quite the opposite, it’s just different and a different phase of life. Priorities can start to change in your 30s. I stay home more, party less, a lot of friends have left the city or started families, etc. I took up marathon running, which is really great in NYC because I live near Central Park and it’s great for running every day. We have a lot of races that I like to participate. I still go out to eat, go to Broadway shows and museum exhibits, etc. But I’ve slowed down. I’m more settled in my routines and my friend groups now. NYC just feels more like home and real life than the feverish-ness of my 20s. I think it’s just me getting older. \n\nI’m hoping that my next chapter of life involves marriage and kids. I’d like to see NYC through a child’s eyes and have another phase of discovering the city with them.

Because “algorithm promotes you” is opposite of what it would do in a communistic environment.", "So children's parents having wealth means that those children are too good or unwilling to learn a trade? Did the kids tell you they didn't want to see tradespeople, or is that just something decided by the faculty?\n\nI graduated with honors, took and completed several ap classes (then passed the test, fuck you very much AP World and Stats) and then hit a 30 on my ACT. Parents worked federal public sector, so I had a very solid upbringing. I Had my own business washing windows, did okay in sports and had a long history of arts and theater to put into my electives basket. Not tooting my own horn here, just putting in perspective that I'm not some idiot by any bureaucratic standard in academia (aka, admissions).\n\nNot the same as a private school, but I went to a competitive and selective charter school surrounded by largely upper middle and lower upper class students. Think children of government workers, everyday lawyers and doctors, SKILLED TRADESPEOPLE etc.\n\nReceived competitive scholarship offers from Tulane, MSU, St Johns, Columbia and even a full ride offer from WVU.\n\nWanna guess what I am? A Union Electrician.\n\nI fucking wish I hadn't wasted my money or time going to college (I chose MSU, Go Green) and I wish even more that the blue collar route was discussed more during my schooling. You would be surprised at just how many of those precious rich kids actually WOULD do fantastic in the trades. I know (anecdotally), because every 10th 20 something I run into in the field is some rich kid college drop out, or someone who is basically starting a second career in the trades. For example, I regularly run into former teachers, former tech bros, people with masters degrees in biology, history, even met an archeologist once.\n\nBut I guess I'm just a degenerate, dirty, crass construction worker, even if I'm doing better than, or as well as, the significant majority of my HS alma mater. I might track dirt through your hallways and poison the minds of our future businesspeople with my dirty commie talk of Unions and earn while you learn schooling.\n\nYou should consider pushing to at least let union trades come by. Sorry if this comes across as an attack on you, because it isn't. I find the belief that wealthier children aren't interested/are too good for the trades to be not only wrong, not just offensive, but actively harmful.\n\nOfc I just typed out all of that, and it could be a giant waste of time because maybe your student body really does hate the trades or something. I just hate to think there are kids out there like me who were never even given the opportunity to take so much as a shop class, let alone have visits from union tradespeople to discuss the ins and outs of a proper apprenticeship in a calculated manner,  and not just some half assed footnote mention by someone's parent on career day.", "As a non American would a “top military school” (I’ve heard of West Point being the one) be allowed to recruit from private schools. Ie go to this school to avoid combat but still military", "I meant in their comment.", "In Soviet Russia, long standing jokes are aware of you!", "No rich family is looking for their children to be electricians.", "My school’s student body is 100% female, 70% international (mostly Asia), and our average graduating class has 20 students. Two thirds of our graduates either have or are pursuing graduate degrees when they attend their 5-year reunion. They and their parents are not interested in the trades, they want to be doctors and lawyers and engineers and artists. They complete, on average, a full year of college worth of of credits prior to graduation through APs and dual enrollment, which is a requirement in our curriculum and one of the reasons we attract our students. Simply put, we are a small school that caters to a specific type of student and family. We know that and we’re fine with it.", "But if they need something fixed? Ooooooh boy are they gonna pay for it\n\nTrades used to be seen as a \"job for stupid people\", but now that people would rather pay someone else to do it (be it busy/lazy/kids/specific models), trade people make good money\n\nIs it as much money as being a doctor? No, but going to a prestigious school knowing your child likes to tinker with stuff can push them in a direction they didn't know they liked", "We don’t have a market for the military academies but if we had student interest and they were willing to visit I think we would allow it. The recruiters who park outside the cafeteria in the public schools and try to rope kids in with signing bonuses and lofty talk of seeing the world (this is what I remember from when I was a student at the public high school closest to the one I work for) would not be allowed on campus.", "Ah, somehow it looked like you responded to me and I didn't see this other user.", "As someone with a Master's, went to a private college, and is a woman: you're still full of crap. Your students/parents might *want* to go into degree-based fields, but that doesn't mean they'll be successful in them. Taking away a student's chance to be exposed to other opportunities, even if they ultimately reject them, robs them of the ability to make an informed choice. You're also reinforcing the stereotype that women aren't suitable/wanted in trades, which is crappy all around. ", "Thank you for your response. \n\nThe IBEW appreciates and recruits women, we have initiatives targeted at bringing more women into the trades. Funny enough, the archaeologist I mentioned above is a woman. She has a master's. \n\nThank you for taking the time to respond. While the IBEW may not be a top target for your students and their families, maybe don't *quite* count us out.\n\nAll in all, though. Fair enough! You certainly know the situation better than some random like me! \n\nTo any other faculty of selective or private schools that may come across this:\n\nHonestly? We'll probably be seeing some of your students, whether you point them our way or not.", "We are at the mercy of the families who pay to send their kids to us, and they would have an issue with us pushing what they see as less desirable. We cannot invite a group to our campus to speak to our students if doing so would cause families to pull their students and send them elsewhere. We also have an extremely high percentage of international students who are not eligible to go into those fields in this country, so it doesn’t make sense in that regard either. Our students are more than welcome to research any pathway they feel is best for them and we are happy to help them in that regard, but we don’t push certain avenues at the institutional level because it doesn’t make sense for the families we serve.\n\nIt’s also incredibly patronizing to look at a student and think “you might WANT to study medicine, but you won’t be successful so you should go into a trade instead.” Our kids are successful in an advanced academic environment, we don’t take just anyone off the street, they have to be able to get in based on academics. Someone who can’t be successful in a university setting also can’t be successful at our school. We believe all our students can succeed in anything they put their mind to, and to assume otherwise is just rude.", "Fair point, you're in a highly-curated environment and your school doesn't get paid if you don't meet the parents' expectations. Still sucks for the kids who might have enjoyed working in trades, but whaddya gonna do", "“Oh no, I wanted to be a plumber, but being a doctor is the only path open to me. Boo hoo, boo hoo.”"]}

He would come over to be with me just to lay in bed next to me. He was only concerned about getting me well.

And not to be TMI but it's definitely an extremely important part of a relationship, the sex is the best of my entire life. And I do think it goes back to my first point. He pays attention. \n\nIve kissed a few frogs in my life and the one thing I would go back and tell my younger self, or even to young women now, if you don't feel his love, he's not the one. If you're having to question things, he's not the one. There's a security and contentment to the right person. He's the one I want to share everything with.

Got married 58 days later.", "I had very limited time to socialize (I worked nights at a hospital and had undiagnosed Crohn's disease), so my free time was precious to me. I had been dating for about a year on and off, and I knew a guy wasn't it when I'd rather be home sleeping or relaxing. I know my husband was my husband because I couldn't get enough of him.

I was sat next to him while he was unconscious and still unstable. I wanted him to live, and when he was stabilized I thought - if he had died, I would not want to be anywhere but here. And that's when I knew the magnitude of my love and desire to be his life-partner. \n\nCut to five years later -- we were married a year or so and hadn't had sex in about three years. I had a conversation with a friend about this issue (he had been a priest for years but left in order to get married) and he advised that I look at our whole life, and sincerely ask and answer myself  if there is enough there for me. He acknowledged that my desire for sexual intimacy was normal and right, and that this kind of issue was not uncommon. \n\nWe did couples' therapy and it turns out he is asexual but not aromantic. I had to do a lot of thinking and processing around this but  I also had to be honest: this man is my best friend, he is my help-mate and true life partner; I want to spend time with him even if we're just playing video games separately but listening to the same podcast.  \n\nThis man loves me, cares for me, makes decisions and investments for our future together. I still think fondly of when I chose to marry him, but I think in my story it's more important to me to remember why I choose to remain his wife. \n\n(We've been together 13 years and married 8 years)", "He’s the only person in the world I can be “alone” with.", "I miss my husband so much. For a million different reasons. His laugh. His hands. The way his face would light up when he saw me come through the door.\n\nBut the most selfish one is I’m a T1 diabetic and he used to rub my feet every night. I miss that, true, but more than missing the act I miss knowing that there’s someone on this Earth who cares about me enough to WANT to do that.\n\nSorry for rambling. I’m not even sure that made sense.\n\nI knew he was the one the first time I heard his voice - deep, and slow, and Southern.

Then I moved out and was mostly on my own, and just kinda used it as a drying rack... \n\nI went to my now-husband's house where he was living with his brother. We were throwing a party and cleaning up/ prepping for it and I used their dishwasher as a drying rack. His brother, jokingly, asked \"who loaded this like a dumdum?\" He didn't know I was within earshot and without thinking explained the situation and that it was nice that I did *their dishes* for the party. \n\nIt was such a small thing but it showed me that he always put my best face forward and would stick up for me in big ways and small things", "I feel safe, cared for, he makes me laugh, he’s strong and sexy, capable, clean, smart, considerate, can cook, I could go on 💗", "I was a Born Again Christian at the time we met.

If i didn’t have someone love me this much, i deserve better", "He  is the only person who is honestly interested in how I feel even though I can’t communicate it in a classical way.

He is my doom insurance.", "When I realized life would suck without him.", "That man does miracles for my nervous system. He’s a soothing presence, and as an anxious person, I can’t get enough of it. I’ve never felt calm with anyone else like I do with him. And he just fits me and I him. He’s the most understanding, cuddly and ridiculous person I could ever fathom. He makes me want to do better. And when he slipped my engagement ring on my finger while we were curled up, me 90% asleep and feeling so loved and safe, there was no way I was saying no.

We were long distance at the time so on the phone talking about everything that had just happened. I hadn’t slept all night. Day 2 was worse than day 1. He made me laugh somehow and I didn’t think that could have been possible. \n\nWe hadn’t been dating very long but after that he really stepped up to the plate and made the relationship serious. \n\nWe make each other laugh every day, communicate well, find resolve to conflict quickly, and share common goals/morals/values.
